## Tutorial on CLI

If you're already familiar with CLI, that's great! Feel free to move on to the next section about setting up
MoneyGoWhere.

For those who are new to CLI, this section will give you a simple introduction.

So, what is CLI? Well, the device you are using needs to get instructions from you, and you might be familiar with
clicking on icons and images to send these instructions. However, with CLI, you type these instructions.

MoneyGoWhere will prompt you to enter your instructions, such as:

## Setting up MoneyGoWhere

1. Before installing and using MoneyGoWhere, do note that Java 11 is required. If you do not already have it installed,
   you can do so [here](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/downloads/#java11).
    * For Windows users, download the x64 Installer. Ensure you are on the "Windows" page and download the correct
      version, in the red box.

      ![](https://i.imgur.com/ibRX7fQ.png)

    * For Mac users, download the ARM 64 DMG Installer.Ensure you are on the "macOS" page and download the correct
      version, in the red box.

      ![](https://i.imgur.com/DGn8lrt.png)

1. After installing Java
   11, [please download the latest release of the `MoneyGoWhere.jar` file](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113T-T09-2/tp/releases).
   Click on `MoneyGoWhere.jar` to automatically download the file. Ensure that it is the latest version (the one with
   the biggest number).

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/V8xLkBL.png)

1. Find `MoneyGoWhere` in your Downloads folder.

1. Open `cmd` and navigate to the folder where the `MoneyGoWhere.jar` file is. If you are unsure of how to do so, follow
   steps 5 to 7. Otherwise, you may skip ahead to step 8.

1. Open a command [terminal](#glossary) by entering `cmd` in your start menu and select the first [option](#glossary)
   that appears.
   ![](https://i.imgur.com/Ezt3rky.png)

1. Get the file path of `MoneyGoWhere.jar` in your computer. To easily do so, you can do the following:

    * For Windows users, right-click the file and select the "Properties" [option](#glossary). Then, copy the text
      under "Location".
      ![](https://i.imgur.com/bc72Izn.png)

    * For Mac users, right-click the file and select "Copy".
      ![](https://i.imgur.com/mKfwVrc.png)

1. In the CLI, navigate to the location of the folder by typing `cd `, type or paste the file path that you found from
   the previous step by pressing CTRL and V at the same time on your keyboard, then press enter.

    * For example, if the file path that you have is `C:\Users\natas\Downloads\Folder`, then you should
      enter `cd C:\Users\natas\Downloads\Folder` into the CLI.

    <!--* This step is important as it ensures that the saved tasks file will be saved in the same directory. Otherwise, the file will be stored in the current working directory.-->

1. Use the [command](#glossary) `java -jar MoneyGoWhere.jar` to launch MoneyGoWhere.
   If done correctly, you will see this on your first start up:
   ![](https://i.imgur.com/xZ24DTM.png)

1. When you are done using the app, enter `exit` to shut the application down or simply close the window by clicking on
   the `X` on the top right hand corner of the CLI.

## MoneyGoWhere [Commands](#glossary)

<blockquote style="background-color:#EAF5FF; color:#364253; border-color:#3399FF; padding: 2% 3%">

</blockquote>

<blockquote style="background-color:#FEEFD0; color:#364253; border-color:#877039; padding: 2% 3%">
    üí° Even though the <strong>New User</strong> and <strong>Experienced User</strong> commands are entered into the application slightly differently, they both work exactly the same. <br><br> In other words, there is nothing that the <strong>Experienced User</strong> commands can do that the <strong>New User</strong> commands cannot.
</blockquote>

## Style Features

For the following sections, all examples on how to run [commands](#glossary) are shown in images. There are four things
to take note of:

1. Standard text printed by the application is written in **white**.
2. User input is signified and is written in <text  style="color:#88B3F6">**blue**</text>.
3. Success messages and examples of expected output is written in <text  style="color:#7ED321">**green**</text>.
4. Error messages are written in <text style="color:#F25569">**red**</text>.

**When you use the application, the text on your screen will be in white.**

We have chosen to color-code our examples so it is easier for you to follow along and tell apart different parts of the
examples.

Here is an example of what you can expect to see in this Guide.

![](https://i.imgur.com/MT5YgYP.png)

For those reading the **New User** sections, do also note the following:

1. At any point, if you wish to exit from the command, you can do so with `/cancel`

For those reading the **Experienced User** sections, do also note the following:

1. Any words surrounded by `<>`, such as `<price>` are for you to fill in.
2. Options that are surrounded by `{}`, such as `{-n "<name>"}` are optional.
3. All values have to be accompanied by options (begins with `-`, such as `-n` or `--price`). Commands such
   as `/deleteitem delete -i 10` will be an invalid [command](#glossary).

## Item Features

Before you start taking orders, you will need to set up your menu. This must be done at least once.

Depending on the size of your menu, you may need to spend quite a bit of time to add all of your menu items into
MoneyGoWhere. It is important that you do this before opening shop for the day, to ensure that your business can be run
without any disruptions.

You may continue to add new items to the menu at any point of time.
<!--This should be a one-time process, but you can always add more items or remove old items at any point.-->

## Add an Item

If you need to add an item to the menu, you can use this [command](#glossary). To add an item, you will need the item's
name and price.

<h3> <strong>For New Users </strong></h3>

This example will show you how to add an item step-by-step.

1. John starts the application for the first time. He sees the greeting and knows that he set up the application
   correctly. Now, he wants to add **White Chicken Rice**, which costs **$4.50** to the menu.

![](https://i.imgur.com/YBkgvEQ.png)

2. He sees that he is successful and feels happy that the application is easy to use. Now, he wants to add **Egg**,
   which costs **$0.80** to the menu.

![](https://i.imgur.com/qeTaDFj.png)

3. Lastly, John uses [`listitem`](#List-all-Items) to check that he has added the items correctly.
   **//TODO: HYPERLINK listitem**.

    üí° To use the command in this manner, remember to add a <code>/</code> before the command, such as <code>/additem</code>. 
</blockquote>

**[Command](#glossary) Format**
These are the different command formats that are accepted when adding a new item into the menu.

```text
/additem --name "<item name>" --price <price>
```

```text
/additem -n "<item name>" -p <price>
```

You may also interchange the location of the [flags](#glossary) in the commands.

For example, the following command is also valid.

```text
/additem  -p <price> -n "<item name>"
```

This example below will show you how to add an item in a single command.

1. John starts the application for the first time. He sees the greeting and knows that he set up the application
   correctly. Now, he wants to add **White Chicken Rice**, which costs **$4.50** to the menu.

**1. Name already exists**

MoneyGoWhere does not allow for multiple items with the same name. If you try to put in an item with the same name, you
will get the following error.

**Solution:** Use a different name.

<br> 

**2. Price has more than two [decimal places](#glossary)**

MoneyGoWhere does not allow you to enter a number with more than two [decimal places](#glossary). This is because there
are no such denominations in real life.

![](https://i.imgur.com/bGhE59B.png)

**Solution:** Limit the price to 2 decimal points.

**1. Invalid index**

You will not be able to delete an item if the index number of that item does not exist in the menu.
In other words, you cannot remove something that does not exist!

**Solution:** Use a valid index.

üìñ John has been happily using MoneyGoWhere to input all his items. However, he is a bit clumsy and entered a few wrong things. This is what the menu currently looks like: <br><br>

![](https://i.imgur.com/6Q3hSNz.png)

He wants to change two things. First, the word <strong>"Vegebatles"</strong>  at index number 6 is spelt wrongly. Also, he wants to <strong>increase the price of "Vegetables" to $2.00</strong>. </br></br> Next, the item <strong>"Curry Chicken Rice" should cost $5.50</strong>. He can update these items with the <code>updateitem</code> command.

**1. Missing Index**
